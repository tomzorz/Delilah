## Important notice

This is an *it just worksâ„¢* software. That means that it's probably messy, not extensible, has no design patterns applied and just bad to look at overall. Think of it as R&D by trial and error - if I ever "finish" it, I'll probably rewrite it to be nicer, but until then don't judge :D
